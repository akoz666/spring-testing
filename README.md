## Spring Bank Demo

This is a simplistic demo project to intended how some of the Spring tools can be used to improve your Spring test suite.
The presentation can be found in *docs/presentation.pdf* and read the comments below to find out where each concept has been applied.


### Embedded database

An example of an application context with an embedded database can be found in *src/test/resources/embedded-db-application-context.xml*.

Test of the example database can be seen in *src/test/java/com/jayway/repository/EmbeddedDbConfigurationTest.java*.


### Transactional Tests

Transactions are used in some tests, e.g. *src/test/java/com/jayway/repository/AccountEntityTransactionalTest.java*.

Rembember to *flush* your JPA entity manager and your Hibernate session to avoid false positives when testing.


### Profiles

An example of an application context with two profiles can be seen in *src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/application-context.xml*.
The test *src/test/java/com/jayway/service/AccountServiceImplTest.java* uses the `@ActiveProfiles` annotation, and the *src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml* uses the `spring.profiles.active` context parameter.


### Mockito

A pure Mockito test that does not use any Spring releated tools is exemplified in *src/test/java/com/jayway/controller/BankControllerBasicTest*.

If mock object is used as a Spring bean in an application context, it should be *reset* `Before` or `@After` a test to certify that it is always in clean state before the next test is executed.


### Controller Tests

The test *src/test/java/com/jayway/controller/BankControllerRequestTest.java* uses the existing `MockHttpServletRequest` and `MockHttpServletRespone` classes.
The test *src/test/java/com/jayway/controller/BankControllerMvcTest.java* is based on the upcoming `MockMvc` framework.


### Integration Tests

Two maven plugins have been added to the *pom.xml* file to automate the integration tests.
* `jetty-maven-plugin` starts the application in pre-integration-test phase and stops it in the post-integration-test phase.
* `maven-failsafe-plugin` executes the integration test during the integration-test phase (Ã¬n contrast to the `maven-surefire-plugin` that executes tests in the test phase).

The *src/test/java/com/jayway/application/BankApplicationIT.java* is an integration test that uses `REST-assured` to verify that the application's REST API is working.
